#  Deepfake Video Detection using Deep Learning

##  Overview
This project focuses on detecting **AI-generated or manipulated videos** using advanced **deep learning** techniques.  
Deepfakes use artificial intelligence to mimic real people by altering facial movements and expressions.  
This system analyzes **facial features, blinking patterns, lighting, and pixel-level irregularities** to distinguish between real and fake videos.

##  Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow / Keras  
- **Model Architecture:** Xception (pre-trained on ImageNet)  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-learn  

---

##  Objective
To build a **deep learning-based detection system** that can accurately identify manipulated or AI-generated videos, helping to fight misinformation, identity theft, and digital fraud.

---

##  Features
- Detects **deepfakes** using CNN-based architectures  
- Analyzes **facial movement, blinking, and lighting** inconsistencies  
- Supports **video frame extraction and preprocessing**  
- Uses **transfer learning** with XceptionNet for efficient training  
- Outputs **real-time predictions**: *Real Video* or *Deepfake Detected *
